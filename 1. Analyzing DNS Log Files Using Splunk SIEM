1. Uploading DNS logs into Splunk  
2. Running basic queries  
3. Investigating anomalies and suspicious domains

## ✅ Prerequisites  
Before starting, make sure you have:  
- A running **Splunk instance** (Enterprise, Free, or Splunk Cloud).  
- **DNS log data sources** (e.g., BIND, Windows DNS, Zeek/Suricata).

## 📂 Uploading Sample DNS Logs into Splunk  

### 1. Prepare Log Files  
- Extract the sample `.json` file.  
- Ensure the logs contain fields such as `src_ip`, `dest_ip`, `fqdn`, `query_type`, `response_code`.  

### 2. Add Data to Splunk  
- Log in to **Splunk**.  
- Navigate: **Settings → Add Data → Upload**.  
- Select your **DNS log file**.  

### 3. Configure Input  
- **Source type** → Select `_json` (or create `dns_sample`).  
- **Index** → Choose (or create) a dedicated index, e.g., `dns_index`.  
- Review settings → ✅ Submit.  

### 4. Verify Data  
Run a quick search to confirm logs are ingested:  
```spl
index=dns_index sourcetype=dns_sample
